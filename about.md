## Background
I have been been red teaming for 6 years and I have been bug hunting since Fall 2021. My bug hunting experience has been mostly on Synack's Red Team platform. I prefer it over other platforms due to fast triage times and consistent payouts. 

The goal of this blog is to help people get into web application security by sharing my experience with hunting on production environments. Many researchers get their start in a learning environment such as PortSwigger's platform (great resource btw) or TryHackMe, but it can be a shock moving from these learning platforms to live networks. 

The internet is a strange place and I aim to give you a few tools that might make the journey a bit easier. 

In my spare time, I love spending time with my wife and son, playing video games, and playing tabletop RPGs.
