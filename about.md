## Background
I have been a red teamer for 6 years as and a bug bounty hunter for 1 year. I exclusively hunt on Synack's Red Team Platform, although I hunted briefly on HackerOne's public programs. I am mostly a generalist and I do not specialize in any particular bug class.

In my spare time, I love spending time with my wife and son, playing video games, and playing tabletop RPGs.
