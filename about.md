## About Me
My name is Austin and I have been red teaming for around 7 years and bug hunting since the Fall of 2021. My bug-hunting experience has been mostly on Synack's Red Team platform with a few bugs on HackerOne. In the first 6 months as a researcher, I found quite a few duplicates and my other bugs were marked informational. My first actual payout was an information disclosure worth $90. At that point, I was close to quitting, but I took a break for a month, spent a lot of time studying, and then came back and discovered an RCE.

From my initial time as a researcher, I learned to be persistent and to focus on improving rather than chasing a payout. I also found it vital to take breaks, even if a new subdomain popped up or the scope opened up on one of your targets. It can be easy to burn yourself out as I nearly did in the beginning.

In my spare time, I love spending time with my wife and son, playing video games and tabletop RPGs.
