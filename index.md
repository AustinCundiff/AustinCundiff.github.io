## Background
I have been in the offensive cyber community for 6 years as a penetration tester and I've been a bug bounty hunter for 1 year. I exclusively hunt on Synack's Red Team Platform, although I hunted briefly on HackerOne's public programs. In my spare time, I love spending time with my wife and son, playing video games, and playing tabletop RPGs.
