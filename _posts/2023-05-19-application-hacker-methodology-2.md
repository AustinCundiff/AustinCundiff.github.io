## Application Hacker Methodology Part 2: Identifying Entry Points

### Introduction

In the recon section, we discussed mapping an organization's attack surface, which lines up with Step 1 in [Lockheed's Cyber Kill Chain](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/capabilities/cyber/cyber-kill-chain.html) and Step's 1 & 2 in [Jason Haddix's Bug Hunter Methodology](https://github.com/jhaddix/tbhm). 
Depending on the size of the scope, this can be possibly thousands of URLS, site titles, and link dumps, which can be quite daunting. In order to make sense of all this data, we must learn what we can ignore 
and also learn where an attack is even possible to begin with. The majority of critical bugs in the wild stem from some kind of data entry point. Examples of data entry points include form submissions, queries, account creation/modification, or uploading files. 
The reason why these entry points are so important is because they provide a window to server-side code and back-end systems. It is here where the more important vulnerabilities live.

In this guide, I hope to highlight some common pitfalls when approaching a target scope as well as provide some tips for finding entry points.

### Roadmap

- Determining the Technology Stack ðŸ–§
- Finding Interesting Entry Points ðŸšª


## Filtering Out the Noise

### Our Goals for this phase

* Find and remove static assets that are unlikely to provide us a way of interacting in a meaningful way
* Curate a list of interesting assets to examine

Pre-requisites from the recon phase:
- List of active domains
- URLs from spidering & online archivers
- List of titles from online domains

*Tools used:*: [**Anew**](https://github.com/tomnomnom/anew), [**httpx**](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/httpx), [**Wappalyzer**](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/wappalyzer/), grep

### Weeding out Static Sites

Many bug hunters and web application testers often run into a wall after the recon phase. This is in part due to there not being a deterministic method to finding interesting assets. As you gain experience, you will 
develop a sense for what to ignore and what to target. However, during the first few months of testing against production environments, it is easy to get lost in the sauce. 

#### Tip \#1: Skip Content Management Systems (CMS)

Unless you are testing for specific known bugs such as the Elementor DOM XSS, xmlrpc, or drupaggedon, I would avoid testing a CMS such as Wordpress, Drupal, AEM, or Joomla. The majority of the content you tend to find on these 
systems is static in nature. They are great tools for distributing static content and are pretty hardened these days. However, there are not usually entry points for you to get payloads to server-side code.

```sh
# Generate and brute force new domains based on pre-discovered domains. 
cat domains | dnsgen - | massdns -r ~/resolvers.txt -t A -o L --flush 2>/dev/null | anew dns-gen-domains
cat dns-gen-domains | anew domains && rm -f dns-gen-domains
```



### Conclusion 

Our goal in this phase was to give ourselves a decent attack surface. This is probably the most widely covered phase within the web application testing realm and is by far the easiest. 

Once you have a sufficient number of endpoints to examine, you will want to move into the next phase: Identifying Data Entry Points. We will take interesting sites and strive to fully understand the application and frameworks involved. Once we understand the access controls, we can examine them for flaws.

This phase will be documented in the Application Hacking Methodology Part 2.
